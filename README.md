NOTICE (2014-08-04)
====================

I finished to write a POC code and ready to write this LINE library, but I have a lot of jobs to do these days.. so it might take some time to finish this library..

So I uploaded [poc.py](poc.py) for someone who wants to make a LINE bot ASAP! Just edit the POC code and enojoy it before I finish this LINE library~

**Read the instruction** of [poc.py](poc.py#4) be fore you test the code!
